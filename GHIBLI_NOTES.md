## Key Insights

1. **Timing Gap**: There is a gap between the first reported transaction on pump.fun (March 26, 03:15) and the first available price data from Alchemy (March 27, 08:04 UTC). This means the initial price movements are not captured in our analysis.

2. **Wild Card Early Period**: If we had been able to trade on pump.fun directly during the ~29-hour period between the reported first transaction and our earliest available price data, the ROI potential is a complete wild card. Initial token launches often experience extreme volatility, with prices potentially starting orders of magnitude lower than where they stabilize. Without data from this critical early period, we cannot rule out the possibility of much higher returns for the earliest investors.

3. **Optimal Strategy (Based on Available Data)**: From the data we have, the best ROI would have been achieved by investing at the earliest available price point and selling approximately 19 hours later at the global maximum, for a 106.69% return ($50 â†’ $103.34).

4. **Rapid Decline**: The token price declined dramatically after reaching its peak, losing over 60% of its value within 4 days of the earliest available price data.

5. **Correlation with Social Trends**: The token's price reached its peak approximately 16 hours after becoming a significant trend on Farcaster, suggesting a strong correlation between social media activity and price movement.

6. **No Confirmed Path to $15K**: Based on the available data, there was no realistic path to turning $50 into $15,000 through a single investment in Ghibli token starting from our earliest price point. The maximum recorded ROI was approximately 106%, far short of the ~30,000% required for such a return. However, had investors been able to purchase at the true launch price (which is unknown to us), the returns could potentially have been much higher.
