This needs to be 10-100x greater for Farcaster to be sustainable.\n\n2. We've also seen a lot of previously \"churned\" users reactivate on Farcaster.\n\n3. We've significantly upgraded our developer UX with mini apps (formerly frames) and wallet. 70K+ funded wallets.\n\n4. We've scaled our USDC rewards programs for content, mini apps and invites. $250K+ in USDC rewards and growing.\n\n5. We've introduced a new series of verifications to help developers better understand users on the protocol. Over 150K+ users have at least one verification.\n\n6. We've launched airdrop offers, allowing developers to target Farcaster users who use their apps via mini apps.\n\n7. Snapchain is launching soon. It's a novel, blockchain-like distributed system that will allow us to scale the protocol for the next 10x.\n\n8. We've grown the team by 50% since the start of the year.\n\n1/3",
