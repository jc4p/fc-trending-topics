      "text": "I am hiring Farcaster devs.\n\nAs context, I\u2019m the former CTO of Coinbase. While there I drove our transformation from a four asset company (BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC) to the infinite asset backend Coinbase has now. I also championed and led the USDC launch at Coinbase, taking it from $0 to $1. And worked closely with , who has been a friend for 10+ years.\n\nSo, if you want to build real crypto products \u2014 not gambling, not vaporware \u2014 come work with us. I think Farcaster is exceptionally underrated as a protocol and want to use it as the backbone for a new kind of crypto-first school.\n\nTo motivate: imagine if every problem you solved in college doubled as a portfolio piece \u2014 as a *proof-of-learning* NFT added to your public ENS.\n\nThat would build a new kind of AI-proof verifiable resume. And that is what we want to build on Farcaster. So, come work with us!\n\nhttps://jobs.ns.com/33467",

      "text": "Where we are and where we're going\n\n1. Recently, we've seen a decent increase in daily active users (DAU). Between 200K and 300K users open Warpcast every month. This needs to be 10-100x greater for Farcaster to be sustainable.\n\n2. We've also seen a lot of previously \"churned\" users reactivate on Farcaster.\n\n3. We've significantly upgraded our developer UX with mini apps (formerly frames) and wallet. 70K+ funded wallets.\n\n4. We've scaled our USDC rewards programs for content, mini apps and invites. $250K+ in USDC rewards and growing.\n\n5. We've introduced a new series of verifications to help developers better understand users on the protocol. Over 150K+ users have at least one verification.\n\n6. We've launched airdrop offers, allowing developers to target Farcaster users who use their apps via mini apps.\n\n7. Snapchain is launching soon. It's a novel, blockchain-like distributed system that will allow us to scale the protocol for the next 10x.\n\n8. We've grown the team by 50% since the start of the year.\n\n1/3",
