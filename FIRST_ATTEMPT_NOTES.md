This document evaluates the three initial approaches tried for Farcaster trending topic detection, highlighting successes, failures, and opportunities for optimization.

## Approach 1: Direct LLM Analysis

### Successes
- Provided clear explanations for each identified topic
- Effectively captured high-engagement cryptocurrency/token topics
- Included estimated percentage metrics for each topic
- Identified key terms and entities with frequency data

### Failures
- Mixed unrelated topics (e.g., "$CASTER AI and Cryptocurrency Data" combined two separate domains)
- Key entities sometimes repeated across different topics (e.g., "Caster AI" appearing in multiple topics)
- Appeared to focus narrowly on cryptocurrency/token topics at the expense of other trending discussions
- Potentially missed more specialized, niche topics

## Approach 2: LDA + K-Means Clustering

### Successes
- Provided detailed exemplar posts for each topic
- Captured gaming-related topics that Approach 1 missed
- Included percentage breakdown for topic distribution
- Calculated trending scores for objective ranking

### Failures
- Produced questionable percentage distributions (94.5% for "Base Chain Photography & Sharing")
- Mixed unrelated topics frequently (e.g., "Mystery Location Game & Tokens" combined a geography game with token deployment)
- Another example is "Warpslot and Gate of Degen Wins" conflating two separate games
- "$Saindy and /impact Rewards" incorrectly merged token promotion with reward claiming
- Topic boundaries seemed arbitrary in several cases

## Approach 3: Embeddings-Based Clustering

### Successes
- Created the cleanest topic separation among all approaches
- Each topic was coherent and focused on a single domain
- Included engagement insights that explained why topics were trending
- Effectively identified gaming topics beyond cryptocurrency discussions
- Provided sentiment analysis for each topic

### Failures
- Identified fewer topics than other approaches (5 vs 8-9)
- May have missed smaller but relevant topics due to clustering thresholds
- Less detailed percentage/frequency information compared to other approaches
- Did not provide exemplar posts like Approach 2

## Common Issues Across Approaches

1. **Topic Mixing**: All approaches, to varying degrees, combined distinct concepts into a single "topic"
2. **Inconsistent Coverage**: Each approach captured different aspects of the conversation space
3. **Limited Filtering**: None effectively filtered out basic/common topics vs truly "trending" topics
4. **Baseline Comparison**: No approach established what "normal" conversation looks like vs "trending"

## Optimization Opportunities

Before pursuing the next approaches listed in the README.md, we should consider:

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combining the clean separation of Approach 3 with the detailed metrics of Approaches 1 and 2
2. **Topic Coherence Scoring**: Adding a metric that penalizes mixed topics and rewards focused ones
3. **Time-based Analysis**: Incorporating temporal trends to better distinguish "trending" from "popular"
4. **Topic Novelty Filtering**: As mentioned in the README, implementing filtering that penalizes common baseline topics
5. **Cross-validation**: Using outputs from all three methods to validate and refine results

## Next Steps

As noted in the README.md, we should next explore:

1. **Topic Novelty Filtering**: Apply the smart filtering system that penalizes common baseline topics
2. In the future, we might consider more advanced approaches like:
   - Full Reinforcement Learning Approach
   - Negative-Only Learning Approach
   - Generator-Critic LLM Approach

These next steps should address the core issue of mixed topics and establish better mechanisms for identifying truly novel, trending discussions.
